When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to share it with someone or you have code that you want to make public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it could be that you just want to have a version of the code for you to experiment but you don't want to make it public

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork-> happens in GitHub and makes a clone from a GitHUb repository
	clone-> copies a repository from a repository on gitHub to a local machine
	branch->makes a "different version"of your code so you can make different changes without changing the main branch
